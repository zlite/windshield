Windshield

Windshield is the software for driving a model car on a race course, using the camera to detect the track. It competed in the DIY Robocars race on January 21, 2017 (https://www.meetup.com/DIYRobocars/events/236393485/), and was the only car that successfully finished the lap. The race track was marked with white tapes, like in the photo: https://www.meetup.com/DIYRobocars/photos/27550435/#457707167

Windshield consists of three programs:

drive controls the car. It runs on Raspberry 3 with the camera and Navio2 board to control the motors. (https://docs.emlid.com/navio2/)
look plays back the video recorded by drive for analysis. drive records every 5th image frames captured by the camera. look runs on Linux with GUI.
(The directory think contains the image processing code, shared by drive and look.)
birdeye calibrates the camera pose and produces the matrix to tranform the images to bird's-eye view.
Hardware Requirements

The drive program runs on Raspberry 3 with the camera and Navio2 board to control the motors. The drive program does not use any sensors other than the camera. You can modify drive/Motor.cpp and drive/Radio.cpp to support other motor cotrol boards.

As a safety measure, the drive program reads the throttle position of your RC transmitter and use it to set the speed of the car. You need a RC transmitter and a receiver supported by Navio2.

Software Configuration

Windshield requires OpenCV 3 on both Raspberry Pi 3 and the host computer.

Windshield is built with cmake. On Raspberry Pi 3

cd drive
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
Do the same thing on the host computer for look and birdeye.

Calibration

Download the OpenCV chessboard pattern https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/doc/pattern.png
Print it out. Tape it on the floor in front the car. Take a picture of it from the pi camera using raspistill (https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/raspicam/raspistill.md). It should look like pic3.jpg in birdeye directory: https://github.com/compound-eye/windshield/blob/master/birdeye/pic3.jpg

Replace birdeye/pic3.jpg with the picture you just took. Run birdeye. Copy the output matrix to the variable Hdata in think/Compute.cpp.

Drive

On Raspbery Pi 3, create the directory rover-images under the home directory. The drive program will save every 5th images from the camera in rover-images.

Turn on the RC transmitter. Make sure the light on the receiver is on. Move the throttle to the lowest position.

From drive directory, start the program with the command sudo build/rover. Raise the throttle. (The drive program needs su privilege for the access to Navio2.)

Control-C to stop the drive program.

Look at the Video Log

Here are the images from the successful race lap: https://github.com/compound-eye/rover-images

In look/main.cpp, uncomment the suitable line to select the image files for replay. Save, build, and run.

space bar: pause/resume
up arrow: rewind
left arrow: previous frame
right arrow: next frame
In think/Compute.cpp, uncomment the suitable section to display the images at various stage of processing.

Customization

think/Compute.cpp processes the captured image and results in the steering angle. You will have to tweak it for different race courses (until we have machine learning to figure it out all by itself).

For every images from the camera, think/Compute.cpp performs these steps:

Convert it to grayscale. (cv::cvtColor)
Smooth it out. (cv::blur)
Detect the edges. (cv::Canny)
Find the line segments. (cv::HoughLinesP)
Transform the line segments to bird's-eye view. (cv::perspectiveTransform)
Group the line segments into clusters by their angles.
Pick the steering angle from the cluster of lines with the longest combined length.
Our car uses differential drive, so currently drive/main.cpp steers the car by setting the speeds for the left and right motors. However, as the output from think/Compute.cpp is the steering angle, it should be straightforward to adapt drive/main.cpp for conventional steering. However, if you use the conventional steering, be sure to add a filter to smooth out the steering control, or you will wear out the steering servo very fast.
